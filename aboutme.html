    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Max Caluori and I am a sophomore here at URI. My majors are Japanese and Computer Science. Even though this is my first time programming, I can't wait to get better!<br>One of my best friends is really good at it, and I am especially excited for her to watch me learn the basics.</p>
