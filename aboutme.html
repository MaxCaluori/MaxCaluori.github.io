    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Max Caluori and I am a sophomore here at URI. My majors are Japanese and Computer Science. In my free time I like to play video games and play the drums. I've always been really interested in Japanese culture and language, so when I heard that it was offered as a major here at URI it was an easy choice. Computer Science wasn't as easy, but I saw some classmates doing it and was immediately intruigued. </p>
